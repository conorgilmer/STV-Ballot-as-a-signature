# STV-Ballot-as-a-signature
PR-STV Irregular voting patterns which could be used as a ballot as a signature attack
## Permutations (without repetition)
While the number of permutations of the completing a ballot for the all candidates is factorial(n) or
n!
The number of permutations(P) for r preferences cast, for an election with n candidates is

nPr = P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!

## Tasks
### Data Gathering and Generation
- plot irish political parites on the Political Compass ([politicalcompass.org](https://politicalcompass.org/ireland2020))
- **[PlotRegularVoteTransfers.ipynb](/python/PlotRegularVoteTransfers.ipynb)** - plot regular voting pattern (between similar ideologies)§
- **[PlotIrregularVoteTransfers.ipynb](/python/PlotIrregularVoteTransfers.ipynb)** - plot irregular voting pattern.  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/conorgilmer/STV-Ballot-as-a-signature/blob/master/python/PlotRegularVoteTransfers.ipynb)

- **[VoteDataAnalysis.ipynb](/python/VoteDataAnalysis.ipynb)** - analyse data from e-voting trial from 2002
  - number of preferences cast
  - mode
  - median
  - mean
  - calculate duplicates (remove duplicates)
  - calculate number of unique votes for each vote sequence
  - caclulate possible permutations for each pref nonPr and % used
  - generate histograms number of votes cast for each preference
  - generate pie breakdown of how many preferences voters cast
  - generate bar chart ratio of votes used to possible votes cast for each preference
  - calculate "votes" euclidean distance and average euclidean distance for each transfer
  - classify as "regular" write to *regular* csv file
- **[GenAll-nPr.py](/python/py/GenAll-nPr.py)** 
  - generate all permutations nPr (r=7)
- **[GenVoteDataAnalysis.ipynb](/python/GenVoteDataAnalysis.ipynb)** - analyse generated data
  - calculate "votes" euclidean distance and average euclidean distance for each transfer
  - select rows with euclidean distance greater than max of "Regular" votes
  - classify as "Irregular" write to *irregular* csv file
- **[RandGen-nPr.ipynb](/python/RandGen-nPr.ipynb)** 
  - generate random permutations nPr
- **[RandGen-nPr-O.ipynb](/python/RandGen-nPr-O.ipynb)** 
  - generate O, random permutations nPr (n=candidates, r=preferences, O=number of permutations to generate)
  - calculate "votes" euclidean distance and average euclidean distance for each transfer
  - classify as "irregular" write to irregular csv file
- **[RandGen-nPr-range-of-r.ipynb](/python/RandGen-nPr-range-of-r.ipynb)** 
  - generate random permutations for range r values
- **[concatBatch.py](/python/concatBatch.py)**
  - concatenate(merge) *regular* and *irregular* csv files
  - remove duplicates keeping sequence classified as regular
  - writes to merged csv file

### Machine Learning ([MLElectionData](/python/MLElectionData.ipynb))
- split dataset into test and train
- test machine learning algorithms on dataset measure performance
- tune model
- evaluate performance

### Simulated Election using Generated data
- Run STV with generated data showing synthetic data alters election. Modify **[rcv.py](/python/rcv.py)** to use a fixed droop quota like in Irish Elections, to simulate election.
